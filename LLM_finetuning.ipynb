    "\n",
    "We leverage the QLoRA methodology for fine-tuning, enabling the loading and refinement of LLMs within the constraints of available GPU memory. Quantized Low Rank Adaptation or QLoRA achieves this by applying a clever combination of weight quantization and adapter-based finetuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does QLoRA Work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- QLoRA reduces memory footprint via weight quantization. It compresses the pre-trained model weights significantly.\n",
    "- During fine-tuning, it focuses on optimizing adapter parameters‚Äîlow-rank matrices added to the network, tailored for the specific task.\n",
    "- This selective training is computationally efficient, targeting a smaller set of trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Big Picture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think reparameterization: We inject LoRA weights, training only these, not the entire layer, for fine-tuning.\n",
    "- This technique is key for task-specific model adaptation.\n",
    "- Imagine a hub-and-spoke model for deployment: The hub is the foundational model, and the spokes are task-specific LoRA adapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, on the left, is an overview of the reparameterization implemented with LoRA (with Quantization). This involves a set of low-rank matrices‚Äîthink of these as an essential subset of larger weight matrices‚Äîtrained specifically for the task. On the right, there's a high-level view of a hub-and-spoke model for LLM deployment, where the hub represents the foundational model, and the spokes are the LoRA adapters.\n",

I hope that I have been able to highlight the potential of customizing language models for specific tasks and on how to efficiently finetune LLMs on Intel XPUs. As a suggestion for your continued journey, consider experimenting with different models, adjusting inference settings, and exploring various LoRA configurations to refine your results.
